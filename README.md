# Laboratory Work No. 1 - Object-Oriented Programming Course

## Overview
This project serves as the first laboratory work for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. It involves classifying fictional creatures from various universes based on their characteristics and traits. The application reads data from a JSON file, classifies the creatures into different universes, and writes the output to separate JSON files.

## Requirements
- Kotlin (version 1.5 or higher)
- Jackson Kotlin module
- A JSON file containing creature data formatted correctly
